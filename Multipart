[Reserved and] non-alphanumeric characters replaced are by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character.


That means that for each non-alphanumeric byte that exists in one of our values, it's going to take three bytes to represent it. 
For large binary files, tripling the payload is going to be highly inefficient.
