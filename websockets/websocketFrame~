BydeFault binary data{array Buffer] Is read as blob on clinet side of websocket.


You can change the binaryType on the fly, but it only affects the datatype of received messages. To send binary data you must either send a blob or a typed array. If you send a string it will always be sent (and delivered) as a string. In the wire protocol, a message can be either 'text' meaning the sender sent data encoded as a string, or it can be 'binary' which means that the message contains a raw encoded byte stream. The binaryType indicates how that raw data should be delivered to the application.

In other words, when you set binaryType it means that the next time the message handler fires for receipt of a binary message, that event data will be of type binaryType.
