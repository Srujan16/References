Private constructors prevent a class from being explicitly instantiated by its callers.
There are some common cases where a private constructor can be useful:

classes containing only static utility methods
classes containing only constants
type safe enumerations
singletons

No objects can be constructed, either by the caller or by the native class. This is only suitable for classes that offer only static members to the caller.
