API declaration



Swagger spec - descripiton about the api.

Swagger is basically a set of rules (specification) and tooling for how to semantically describe APIs. Practically, it's a language-agnostic tool that gets everyone on the same page.


Swagger (okay, now the "Open API Initiative"... more on that later!) is a framework for describing your API using a common language that everyone can understand.
