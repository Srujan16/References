The Spring Web MVC framework uses an implementation class of the interface
called HandlerMapping to define the mapping between a request URL and the object that is going to handle that
request (the handler). 

Default UrlHandlerMapping : BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
	This class will use the bean name to map to the URL in the request so that the DispatcherServlet knows which controller must be invoked for handling different URLs.


public clas BlahBlah extends AsbstractCotnroller (or) implements Controller

	public ModelAndView handleRequest(servletRequest, servletResponse)
	{
		return new ModelAndView("hello.jsp")
	}
	
	*Controller handles a request and returns a ModelAndView


Model, which controller returned is resolved by a viewResolver. By default, spring MVC provides a view Resolver to handle models returned by controllers.


	InternalResourceViewResolver - prefix ans suffix

	ResourceBundleViewResolver
	SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
