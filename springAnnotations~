@RequestParam("userId") int userId

@PathParam("projectId") int projectId


@RequestBody Employee employee --> maps entire jsonstring sent int requestBody to Employeee object 
	{"name":"srujan","age":1}



if there are multiple paramaters to be sent in requestBody,
		{"employee":{"name":"srujan","age":1},"student":{"name":"srujan","class":12}}
then RequestBody should be a map	
	@RequestBody Map<String,Object> inputData
	
	and then iterate over map and make use of objectMapper to parse it to required class type.
