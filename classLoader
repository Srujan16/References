JVM

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an execution environment for Java applications. \

The JVM is an abstract computing machine defined by a specification, which is designed to interpret bytecode that is compiled from Java source code.

More commonly, the JVM refers to the concrete implementation of this specification with a strict instruction set and a comprehensive memory model.

It can also refer to the runtime instance of the software implementation. 

The primary reference implementation of the JVM is HotSpot.
