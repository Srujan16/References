Existing functionality with browser:

	1) when name=ab&&&&&cd is sent as queryParam 
 			queryParamMap contains {'name':'ab','cd':null}
			request.getQueryString - ab&&&&&cd

 	2)when name=ab%26%26cd is sent as queryParam 
 			queryParamMap contains {'name':'ab&&cd'}
			request.getQueryString - ab%26%26cd


Expected functionality with restService
	1) when name=ab&&&&&cd is sent as queryParam 
 			queryParamMap contains {'name':'ab','cd':null}
			request.getQueryString - ab&&&&&cd
	
	2)when name=ab%26%26cd is sent as queryParam 
 			queryParamMap contains {'name':'ab%26%26cd'}
			request.getQueryString - ab%2526%2526cd
