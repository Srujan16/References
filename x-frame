The X-Frame-Options HTTP header field indicates a policy that
   specifies whether the browser should render the transmitted resource
   within a <frame> or an <iframe>.  Servers can declare this policy in
   the header of their HTTP responses to prevent clickjacking attacks,
   which ensures that their content is not embedded into other pages or
   frames.
