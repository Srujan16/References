socket.io has it's own connection management stuff BEFORE it connects on a webSocket that allows it to negotiate which type of connection it's actually going to make to the server and allows it to send some configuration options down to the client. This will confuse you if you're trying to study a plain webSocket.


socket.io is an additonal protocol on top of webSocket. It will eventually use a standard webSocket underneath, but it will have additional stuff around that. If you continued to follow the socket.io connection, you would have eventually seen a standard webSocket connection.

I would suggest you first just make a plain webSocket connection from your client (no socket.io) and study that network trace.
