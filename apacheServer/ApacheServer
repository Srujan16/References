1) Install apache server from either of the below links
		http://www.apachelounge.com/download/
		https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
		http://www.wampserver.com/


2) If your apache version is 2.4 then download mod_jk connector from http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/binaries/windows/tomcat-connectors-1.2.40-windows-x86_64-httpd-2.4.x.zip.

   If your apache version is 2.2 then download mod_jk from http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/binaries/windows/tomcat-connectors-1.2.40-windows-i386-httpd-2.2.x.zip 

3) extract the  above zip and place mod_jk.so file  under APACHE_HOME/modules.

4) Add below lines in APACHE_HOME/conf/httpd.conf file.

	    #Load mod_jk module
	    LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
	    JkWorkersFile conf/workers.properties
	    JkLogFile logs/mod_jk.log
	    JkShmFile logs/mod_jk.shm
	    JkLogLevel debug

	    <Location /jk-manager>
	        # Inside Location we can omit the URL in JkMount
	        JkMount jkstatus
        	Order deny,allow
       		Deny from all
        	Allow from 127.0.0.1
    	   </Location>



5) create new file  'workers.properties' and add  below data to workers.properties file. Move workers.properties file to APACHE_HOME/conf.
	worker.list=worker1
	worker.worker1.type=ajp13
	worker.worker1.host=localhost
	worker.worker1.port=8009

	worker.list=worker2
	worker.worker2.type=ajp13
	worker.worker2.host=localhost
	worker.worker2.port=10009

	# Declare Tomcat server workers 1 through n
	worker.list=worker3
	worker.worker3.type=ajp13
	worker.worker3.host=localhost
	worker.worker3.port=9009

	worker.list=jkstatus
	worker.jkstatus.type=status


6) Once this is done , move to APACHE_HOME/bin . Enter httpd -t command to make sure configuration has been done successfully.
	

7) Add the below line in APACHE_HOME/cong/httpd.conf  just after the JkLogLevel line.


	JkMount *wm-desktop-app* worker1 
	JkMount /wavemaker worker1
 	JkMount /static-files* worker2
        JkMount /run-* worker2
	JkMount /run-*/wavemaker worker2
	JkMount /studio* worker3
        JkMount /remote-studio* worker3	
        JkMount /edn-services* worker3
	JkMount /studio*/wavemaker worker3
	JkMount /remote-studio/*/wavemaker worker3
	JkMount /edn-services*/*/wavemaker worker3 
        JkMount /login*	worker3

8) Navigate to APACHE_HOME/bin in command line and enter 'httpd -t' command to validate the configuration changes. 

9) Now, restart apache httpd, make sure that Tomcat is running and then open below URL depending upon setup:

	for desktop-setup open localhost/wavemaker
	for saas-setup open localhost/studio	 
  If you are able to access login page then everything is done.
